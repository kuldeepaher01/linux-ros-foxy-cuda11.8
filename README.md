**Use these scripts to install nvidia drivers and ROS2-Foxy to ubuntu-20.04**
Clone the repo 
and add the executable permission to the shell files. 
For e.g:

    chmod +x cuda.sh

Tip: If you are from Indian and using JIO as your ISP, nvidia drivers and foxy installation might fail as jio has banned raw.github domain.
